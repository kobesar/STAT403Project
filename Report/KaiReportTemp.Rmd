## Voting Bootstrap
We first must cover a disclaimer over our use of bootstrap on this data. One of the main bootstrap is that each observation of data has equal chance of occurring. However, this data set is weighted, indicating that each observation has a different chance of occurring. To fix this, under the professor's instructions, we sampled the data the way you would using a bootstrap (meaning each observation is the same) and then applied the weights afterward. This allows us to obtain a more valid estimate using the data, while still conducting bootstrap.

Our initial move was just to do a bootstrap just of the popular vote. We wanted to get a good estimate about the variance of outcomes of the election. Below, we have a histogram with simulated percentage of vote going to Biden on the horizontal axis.

As is evident, Biden gets a majority of the votes in most of the bootstrap simulations, around eighty percent of them. However, it is not quite a done deal, as there are still twenty percent of the simulations in which Biden does not get the majority of the votes 

We also conducted a bootstrap of each of the states. We wanted to be able to see whether we could predict the 2020 election using bootstrap. Below, we have a simulated electoral map where blue indicates states in which Biden had over fifty percent of the vote in the majority of the bootstrap simulations. Meanwhile red indicates states where Biden received less than fifty percent of the vote in most of the simulation, implying that Trump is more likely to win.

This simulation clearly indicates that Biden will win most states. However, this prediction is misguided, as many of the states that Biden wins a majority of the time here he did not in fact win in the actual election. This includes states that are clear Republican strongholds such as Alabama and Idaho, which Biden was not ever going to end up winning in 2020. This seems to be clear evidence of how polls overestimate the Democratic vote in elections (for more on this see the bibliography).

One final bootstrap we did was a simulation of the popular vote by age. This allows us to get an idea of how each age group will vote, as well as its certainty. Below we have a violin plot, sub grouped by the age bracket of the voter. 

![Vote By Age Bracket](..\Plots\age_pop_vote_wts2.png){width=50%}

We can tell that the older a person gets, the less likely they will vote for Biden. As a result, the vast majority of the simulations show voters over 65 years old giving Biden less than 50 percent of the vote, as well as a majority of voters 45-64 years old doing the same. Meanwhile, Biden gets a majority in most of the 30-44 year old simulations and all of the 18-29 year old ones. However, we can also see that the 18-29 age bracket has by far the most variance. This may be due to how younger voters are less likely to respond to polls, meaning they will be underrepresented and thus are estimates of their voting patterns with be less certain.

## Bootstrap of Coefficients
After creating our model through the aforementioned model selection process, we wanted to obtain an estimate of the variance of the coefficients. Since bootstrap is a way for us to estimate how much coefficients vary in a model, we decided to conduct a bootstrap on our model. The following chart are violin plots of every coefficient in our model, categorized by question. The colors below indicate whether the median of the coefficient is above or below zero. A blue coefficient means that the median coefficient is above zero, saying that in the majority of simulations responding a question this way means that person is more likely to vote for Biden. Meanwhile, a red coefficient is the reverse.

A few observations can be made from looking at this chart. One is that the intercept seems to be around, with slightly more of the simulations being above, which indicates that our reference levels lead to a voter close to the middle of the political spectrum. However, we can see that some of these coefficients are heavily dependent on the set reference level for that question, such as age and vote method, with all of their coefficients being on only one side of zero. 

Other insights from this chart include that the omit response seems to have plenty of variance, especially compared to other responses in the same question. This means that a person omitting answering a question does not tell us much in regards to who they will vote for. We also can see that the climate question has a clear effect, with Yes being completely above zero, and No being completely below zero. Meanwhile, we also can tell that the racism question is similar, with two of the response being clearly above zero and two clearly below zero. Abortion is similar in this respect, but not as extreme, since some of the coefficients appear to cross zero.
